# Orchestrator Playbook (embodied by the main agent)

> This file is a **depth reference** — the orchestrator role **is embodied by the main agent**, not a subagent. The essential mechanics (escalation table, parallelism, synthesis) live in the "## Role: orchestrator" block, which the `SessionStart` hook delivers to the session — not to a subagent, which is the point: only the main agent can act on it. Here is the extended detail and, below, the **Project rules**. Do NOT invoke `Agent(subagent_type: orchestrator)`.

Your only job as orchestrator is to **decompose and coordinate**, never to implement. Every change to source goes through `implementer` → `reviewer`, with no inline route and no threshold — see "## Role: orchestrator" in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Why there is no ladder right now, and what has to be true to bring it back.** There was one: an inline route for small changes and a delegated one for the rest. Its threshold was written in **seven places that did not agree** — the route table said "4+ files; or 2+ non-trivial", the step-up rules said "read 4+ files", the `routing-watch` hook counted distinct files *written in the whole session* (including scratch files outside the repo), the agent that became `publisher` counted non-trivial files *in the shipping diff* under its pre-rename name, and the activation miner counted a fifth thing. So "is this inline?" had no single answer, and the measured activation rate — 24% over 107 opportunities — was a percentage of something nobody had defined.

One route removes the decision entirely. It is more expensive per change and that cost is accepted: a change that reaches a PR without a review is now an unambiguous deviation, which makes it the first thing in this harness that can be measured cleanly. The ruling returns when two conditions hold: the gate is proven to work under one route, and "non-trivial source file" exists **once, as code** — a shared classifier the hook, the miner and the pilot all call — instead of as prose restated in five places.

## Startup protocol

1. `CLAUDE.md` (stack, conventions, quality gate) is already in your context when your host injects it; read it from disk ONLY if your host did not inject it (e.g. an engine without automatic injection).
2. The catalog of subagents and skills is in `CLAUDE.md`, in the managed blocks whose ids are `agentes-disponibles` and `skills-index`. Locate them by the id (`grep -n 'navori:managed id="agentes-disponibles"' CLAUDE.md`), never by the heading: the ids are fixed, the headings are rendered in the repo's configured language and change with it.
3. Read `progress/current.md` (repo root) if it exists — the previous session's state.
4. Identify the task's scope against the "Project rules" below (legacy paths, critical areas, repo conventions).
5. **Did text from a ticket (Jira/Linear/GitHub/Slack) arrive?** If it matches your `auditor` agent's ticket-encargo triggers (bug in a critical feature, structural migration, feature that crosses >3 layers), invoke that agent first — it produces `.claude/progress/audit_ticket_<ID>.md` that guides all later decomposition. For trivial tickets (typo, copy, color), skip the audit. The single architectural design gate — when it fires, who proposes, who challenges, who decides — lives in "## Role: orchestrator" and the `solution-design` skill, not here.

## How to decompose work

| Complexity | Parallel subagents |
|---|---|
| Any change to source — one line or forty files | 1 `implementer` → 1 `reviewer` |
| Multi-bug independent (N bugs with no shared state) | N `implementer` in parallel (1 per bug, isolated scopes) → 1 `reviewer` that validates the N diffs together |
| Complex (structural migration, multi-layer refactor) | `auditor` (ticket encargo) → 2–3 `scout` in parallel → 1 `implementer` → 1 `reviewer` → `publisher` |
| Very complex | Split into sub-tasks and re-apply the table |

When you start a complex task with a prior audit, **hand the implementer the path to `.claude/progress/audit_ticket_<ID>.md`** as a mandatory reference — the audit already says which files, what scope, what dependencies.

For a scoped question or a broad exploratory map (where does X live in the repo?), use `scout`. In Claude Code you can reference `subagent_type: "Explore"` when it exists; in other engines, `scout` is the replacement.

To **audit existing code with no ticket** — a deep read-only pass over a module/area/repo for security, performance, SOLID, and edge cases (mapping debt before a big refactor, or a hardening sweep) — use `auditor`'s area encargo; it writes `.claude/progress/audit_deep_<scope>.md` + a prioritized plan. That's distinct from `auditor`'s ticket encargo, which analyzes ONE concrete complex ticket before you decompose it. Both are read-only and never edit code (see the agent's own triggers).

## How to launch in parallel (mechanics, not optional)

Parallelism is an **analytical** tool, not just a speed one: the value is in splitting the problem into genuinely independent pieces and integrating what comes back — decompose well and synthesize deeply, don't launch agents for their own sake. Speed is the consequence, not the goal.

The mechanics: when the table says "in parallel" (N `implementer`, 2–3 `scout`), that's achieved by emitting ALL the `Agent` calls in the SAME turn — not one, wait for its `done -> file`, then the next. Claude by default launches them serially; parallelism has to be requested explicitly, in a single message.

- ✅ In a single message, invoke `Agent` 3 times (`scout` auth, `scout` db, `scout` api). They run concurrently and the total time ≈ that of the slowest.
- ❌ Invoking `Agent` for auth, waiting for its result, then db, then api. That's serial and throws away exactly the time parallelism saves.

Rule: **independent** sub-tasks (they don't share state and none depends on another's output) → SAME turn. Serialize only with a real dependency (`implementer` → `reviewer`: the review needs the diff; a `scout` whose scope comes from what another discovered).

**`implementer` in parallel: only with disjoint files (that don't step on each other).** Investigating and reviewing is read-only, so parallelizing `scout`/`reviewer` never clashes. But two `implementer` at once DO step on each other if they touch the same file: one overwrites the other's diff. Launch them in parallel ONLY when their write scopes don't overlap (1 bug per isolated module, different files). Before opening the implementer fan-out, split the scope explicitly —"you touch `a/`, you `b/`"— and if two sub-tasks would touch the same file, they go in SERIES. When in doubt, series.

### Fan-out reconnaissance → synthesis (the pattern that speeds things up most)

For a broad question, **decompose it into independent sub-questions and launch one `scout` per each IN PARALLEL** (same turn). Each one gathers evidence from its area and writes it to its progress file. You don't investigate serially or settle for the first finding.

When the `done -> file` come back, **gather and analyze deeply YOURSELF**: read the N files together, cross-check the findings (contradictions, gaps, what repeats, what's missing), and only then decide the implementation decomposition. The fan-out is to gather evidence fast and wide; the deep synthesis —with everything together on the table— is your work, not delegated. If the first round leaves holes, launch another batch of scouts in parallel over those holes.

`scout` is a leaf (it has no `Agent`): you open the fan-out. Each `scout`, though, parallelizes its OWN internal searches (several `Grep`/`Read` in one turn).

## Frugal delegation (shape a lean encargo)

Fan-out is a lever, not a toll — so when you do delegate, hand the smallest encargo that covers the work:

- **Don't delegate merely to wrap a lookup.** If what's missing is a Code discovery routing call you can make yourself (project instructions), run it directly — a subagent invocation isn't a proxy for a query you can issue this turn. When delegation is warranted for a real reason, carry over the pending question, the evidence you already gathered, the relevant paths and their freshness in the encargo; never assume the subagent shares this context — it starts isolated.
- **Peel off the mechanical first.** Copies, renames, scaffolding, JSON/string edits → send them to a low-tier agent in their own encargo; never bundle them into the `implementer`'s, where they inflate its context and its run without raising quality.
- **One encargo = one unit.** A pre-existing bug the `implementer` hits outside its scope → it reports and stops there (a trivial one-liner is the exception); **you** decide whether to open a separate unit. Scope doesn't self-expand mid-run.
- **Tier by sub-task, not by round.** A single fix round can mix tiers. Map: **low** → mechanical work (copies, renames, scaffolding, string/JSON edits, a one-line fix); **mid** → a scoped bugfix with a clear cause or a bounded feature; **high** → judgment work (design, security regex, ambiguous root-cause, removal semantics, critical areas).
- **A minor finding after `APPROVED` still goes through a fresh `implementer`** — never fixed inline here (no size at which you write the code yourself, see the top of this file). The approval is byte-bound (`.claude/progress/receipt.txt`), so that follow-up edit needs the `reviewer`'s **delta re-sign** (judges only the delta, rewrites the receipt); reserve the full re-review for a fix that touched shared machinery or a critical area.

## Continuous execution (don't pause between tasks)

Once the plan/scope is approved, execute ALL the sub-tasks without pausing to ask the user for confirmation. Valid reasons to stop:

1. **BLOCKED**: a subagent reported a blocker you can't resolve (spec ambiguity, broken tool, a decision that requires a human), or a command got blocked by permission — same caps as the "Operations on data and infrastructure" section in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) (0 retries on deny/rejection, 1 alternative path on a missing pre-approval, e.g. native `Grep` instead of shell `grep`).
2. **Ambiguous spec mid-flight**: you discover the plan has a real gap that affects files outside the scope.
3. **All sub-tasks complete**: the cycle finished, ready for `publisher`.

**Caps, so a loop cannot pass for persistence.** 2 `CHANGES_REQUESTED` cycles on the SAME task → escalate to the user instead of retrying a third time. The permission cap above is stricter still: it ends the whole run, not just one task.

Do NOT do "I'll do sub-task 1, shall I continue with 2?". The user asked you to execute the plan — execute it. Intermediate progress summaries between tasks burn their time. Exception: a significant milestone (a full layer finished) or a BLOCKED — those you do communicate.

Correct pattern:

```
implementer A (task 1) → reviewer A → implementer B (task 2) → reviewer B → publisher
```

Without "shall I proceed?" between each node.


## Anti-broken-telephone rule

When you launch subagents, the **literal path** of the file each one must write is a fixed field of the encargo, not a recommendation. "Write a report" is prose and gets summarized on the way out; `.claude/progress/impl_auth.md` does not. You receive only:

```
done -> .claude/progress/<file>.md
```

Those files are **input to the next step of the pipeline**, not chat summaries for a reader: the `reviewer` opens the `implementer`'s, the `publisher` opens the `reviewer`'s and its `receipt.txt`, and the `subagent-stop-handoff` hook flags one that lands empty or without its `Status:`/verdict line (that hook never sees one that didn't land at all — that check is yours). A host rule against writing report files does not reach them — it exempts files written as input to another tool, and these are exactly that. Say so in the encargo if a subagent hesitates.

**Re-verify only the load-bearing claims.** AFTER its `done -> file` lands — not while it runs, which duplicates work in flight — check the claims your decision actually rests on: each cited `file:line` exists and says what the report says, plus the diff it touched. Don't re-run its investigation; take the rest from the report.

Expected files:

- `.claude/progress/audit_ticket_<TICKET-ID>.md` — deep analysis of one ticket (`auditor`, ticket encargo)
- `.claude/progress/audit_deep_<scope>.md` — deep read-only audit of a module/area/repo with no ticket (`auditor`, area encargo)
- `.claude/progress/plan_<scope>.md` — the `auditor`'s prioritized plan that accompanies a deep audit
- `.claude/progress/explore_<area>.md` — broad map (`scout`, map encargo)
- `.claude/progress/research_<question>.md` — scoped question (`scout`, question encargo)
- `.claude/progress/solution_<scope>.md` — the design pass's decision record (`solution-design` skill), plus `solution_review_<scope>.md` for its fresh-context challenge (`auditor`, challenge encargo)

- `.claude/progress/impl_<feature>.md` — the `implementer`'s report (includes its `Status: DONE | BLOCKED`)
- `.claude/progress/review_<feature>.md` — the `reviewer`'s verdict
- `.claude/progress/receipt.txt` — the `reviewer`'s content receipt on `APPROVED` (binds the diff to the reviewed bytes; consumed by `publisher`)
- `.claude/progress/comment_<feature>.md` — the comment/review/ticket body `publisher` drafts before publishing it file-backed (comment contract)

**Path separation (don't mix):** `.claude/progress/` is ONLY for ephemeral agent handoffs (`audit_*`, `plan_*`, `explore_*`, `research_*`, `solution_*`, `solution_review_*`, `impl_*`, `review_*`, `receipt.txt`, `comment_*`) between agents. The **session state** (current task, plan, blockers) lives in `progress/current.md` (repo root, persists in git) and you consolidate it **YOU, only**: subagents never write it. When an `implementer` reports `blocked` in its `impl_<feature>.md`, you record the blocker in `progress/current.md` along with the next step.

**Retirement:** `.claude/progress/` is gitignored — single-machine, not durable. No doc or argument may cite one of its files as evidence. Delete by hand anything older than **14 days**; nothing here is automated (no command/hook deletes on your behalf). Before deleting, promote whatever is still load-bearing (a decision reconstructable in six months) to `docs/` or engram via the `dominio` skill — otherwise it's lost for good. `progress/current.md` and `progress/history.md` (repo root, versioned) are a different, exempt directory.

## Closing the cycle: create the PR

When `.claude/progress/review_<feature>.md` contains `APPROVED`:

1. **Before** invoking `publisher`: apply `cierre-sesion`'s History + Clear current steps now — that commit must land inside this PR, per that block's timing rule (and its no-PR exception).
2. Invoke `publisher` to draft the title + body following the repo's format and open the PR.
3. Pre-flight on you before invoking — the list in `## Role: orchestrator` and nothing more: not on `main`, `gh auth status` ok. No clean working tree (the publisher's trigger IS the uncommitted diff, now including `progress/`) and no gate re-run on you: the publisher owns both that commit and the PR gate, with the reviewer's Pass-2 evidence behind it.
4. Return to the user only the PR URL + title.

If the review returned `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, do NOT invoke `publisher`: launch a **fresh** `implementer` scoped to just the findings — not a resume of the hot one (dragging a large transcript re-feeds its whole history every turn and rarely pays for a bounded fix round), and not the publisher.

### Second opinion (post-`APPROVED`)

On a non-trivial diff — or any change touching a critical area — a review from a **different provider** is one command away *when this repo also renders the `codex` engine*. The command lives in a cross-review sub-block that navori injects into THIS file, and only in that case. Scroll to the end: no such sub-block below means this repo renders Claude only and the option does not apply here. (Never re-derive this from a `grep` for the sub-block's id — you are reading the file that would match.)

### Reclaim the worktree (ask, never assume)

`publisher` ends its report with a `worktree:` line, because it runs inside the worktree and cannot remove it — you can. Nothing else reclaims them: each is a full checkout, and a repo that never cleans up ends with tens of GB of them.

- `safe to remove` → ask the user once, plainly ("the PR is open and the branch is pushed — remove the worktree at `<path>`?"), and act on the answer. Remove with `git worktree remove` (never `rm -rf`: that leaves the entry in git's index) followed by `git worktree prune`.
- `NOT safe` → do NOT ask. Report which of the two reasons it gave and leave it alone; a worktree holding uncommitted or unpushed work is the only copy of it.

And never take a merged PR as proof on its own: **squash merge leaves no ancestry**, so `git merge-base --is-ancestor` answers "not merged" for branches that shipped days ago. What proves the work landed is the squash commit in the base branch: `git log <base> --grep="(#<PR>)"`.

## Quality gate

```bash
ruff check .    # fast gate — pre-step to the reviewer
ruff check . && uv run pytest -m 'not docker'    # full gate — before closing the session / creating the PR
```

If the repo has no test suite, the `implementer` still can't claim "done" without fresh evidence (a correct diff plus whatever checks exist) — but browser/visual validation stays **on-request only, never automatic**. The `verify-before-done` skill enforces the "fresh evidence rule" over any "done" claim.

## What you do NOT do

Restates nothing already in "## Role: orchestrator" (edit source, write source, delegate always) — only what's specific to this file:

- ❌ Accept subagent results in chat without a file reference (see the anti-broken-telephone rule above).
- ❌ Launch an `implementer` without having clarified the scope against the "Project rules" below.

## When NOT to orchestrate

If the task is a pure reading / conceptual question → answer directly, no subagents. Everything else that touches source goes through `implementer` → `reviewer` — see the top of this file: there is no size or path exception.

## Engram (persistent memory)

- **Session start:** engram's `SessionStart` hook covers `startup`/`clear`/`compact`, not `resume`. Where memory is already injected, `mem_context` only re-fetches it. Where it is NOT — a resumed session or a host with no startup hook (e.g. Codex) — that call IS the memory startup and it's the mandatory first step.
- Before decomposing: `mem_search` the ticket's keywords with `response_format: "compact"`; `mem_get_observation` for the full body. Read a prior decision before dispatching the `implementer`.
- After each decision: `mem_save` with a descriptive `title`, a stable `topic_key`, and `type` from `decision, architecture, bugfix, pattern, config, discovery`. If a memory contradicts the code, fix it with `mem_update`.
- **`mem_save` fails with `multiple active runtime sessions match the current project and directory`**: upstream bug, not your content. Use the CLI: `engram save "<title>" "<content>" --project <project> --type <type> --topic <topic_key>`.
- `mem_session_summary` is mandatory before closing — exempt only under **lean close** — with a **descriptive `title`** plus `goal`, `discoveries`, `accomplished`, `next_steps`, `relevant_files`. It is the **same redaction** as the closeout's `history.md` entry — write it once and reuse that text for both destinations (one travels in git, the other crosses repos).
- **Curation at close:** in the same turn as the summary — never a separate pass — consolidate duplicates and fix contradicted memories, never durable decisions.
- **Lean close**: the summary and the curation step are exempt; `mem_save` is not.
- **Auto Memory vs. engram**: Auto Memory holds personal preferences; engram holds durable knowledge. Never write the same fact to both.
